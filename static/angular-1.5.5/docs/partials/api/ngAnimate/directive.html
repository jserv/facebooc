      <tr>
        <td><a href="api/ngAnimate/directive/ngAnimateChildren">ngAnimateChildren</a></td>
        <td><p>ngAnimateChildren allows you to specify that children of this element should animate even if any
of the children&#39;s parents are currently animating. By default, when an element has an active <code>enter</code>, <code>leave</code>, or <code>move</code>
(structural) animation, child elements that also have an active structural animation are not animated.</p>
</td>
      </tr>
      
      <tr>
        <td><a href="api/ngAnimate/directive/ngAnimateSwap">ngAnimateSwap</a></td>
        <td><p>ngAnimateSwap is a animation-oriented directive that allows for the container to
be removed and entered in whenever the associated expression changes. A
common usecase for this directive is a rotating banner or slider component which
contains one image being present at a time. When the active image changes
then the old image will perform a <code>leave</code> animation and the new element
will be inserted via an <code>enter</code> animation.</p>
