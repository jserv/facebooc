<strong>DEPRECATION NOTICE</strong>: Beginning with Angular 1.5, this directive is deprecated and by default <strong>disabled</strong>.
The directive will receive no further support and might be removed from future releases.
If you need the directive, you can enable it with the <a href="api/ngTouch/provider/$touchProvider">$touchProvider#ngClickOverrideEnabled</a>
function. We also recommend that you migrate to <a href="https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick">FastClick</a>.

gives a good overview.
</div>
A more powerful replacement for the default ngClick designed to be used on touchscreen
devices. Most mobile browsers wait about 300ms after a tap-and-release before sending
the click event. This version handles them immediately, and then prevents the
following click event from propagating.</p>

        <td><p>Specify custom behavior when an element is swiped to the left on a touchscreen device.
A leftward swipe is a quick, right-to-left slide of the finger.
Though ngSwipeLeft is designed for touch-based devices, it will work with a mouse click and drag
too.</p>
