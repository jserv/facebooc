<h1 id="security">Security</h1>
<p>This document explains some of AngularJS&#39;s security features and best practices that you should
keep in mind as you build your application.</p>
<h2 id="reporting-a-security-issue">Reporting a security issue</h2>
<p>Email us at <a href="mailto:security@angularjs.org">security@angularjs.org</a> to report any potential
security issues in AngularJS.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind the points below about Angular&#39;s expression language.</p>
<h2 id="use-the-latest-angularjs-possible">Use the latest AngularJS possible</h2>
<p>Like any software library, it is critical to keep AngularJS up to date. Please track the
<a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG</a> and make sure you are aware
of upcoming security patches and other updates.</p>
<p>Be ready to update rapidly when new security-centric patches are available.</p>
<p>Those that stray from Angular standards (such as modifying Angular&#39;s core) may have difficulty updating,
so keeping to AngularJS standards is not just a functionality issue, it&#39;s also critical in order to
facilitate rapid security updates.</p>
<h2 id="expression-sandboxing">Expression Sandboxing</h2>
<p>AngularJS&#39;s expressions are sandboxed not for security reasons, but instead to maintain a proper
separation of application responsibilities. For example, access to <code>window</code> is disallowed
because it makes it easy to introduce brittle global state into your application.</p>
<p>However, this sandbox is not intended to stop attackers who can edit the template before it&#39;s
processed by Angular. It may be possible to run arbitrary JavaScript inside double-curly bindings
if an attacker can modify them.</p>
<p>But if an attacker can change arbitrary HTML templates, there&#39;s nothing stopping them from doing:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;script&gt;somethingEvil();&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>It&#39;s better to design your application in such a way that users cannot change client-side templates.</strong></p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not mix client and server templates</li>
<li>Do not use user input to generate templates dynamically</li>
<li>Do not run user input through <code>$scope.$eval</code></li>
<li>Consider using <a href="api/ng/directive/ngCsp">CSP</a> (but don&#39;t rely only on CSP)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mixing-client-side-and-server-side-templates">Mixing client-side and server-side templates</h3>
<p>In general, we recommend against this because it can create unintended XSS vectors.</p>
<p>However, it&#39;s ok to mix server-side templating in the bootstrap template (<code>index.html</code>) as long
as user input cannot be used on the server to output html that would then be processed by Angular
in a way that would allow for arbitrary code execution.</p>
<p><strong>For instance, you can use server-side templating to dynamically generate CSS, URLs, etc, but not
for generating templates that are bootstrapped/compiled by Angular.</strong></p>
<h2 id="http-requests">HTTP Requests</h2>
<p>Whenever your application makes requests to a server there are potential security issues that need
to be blocked. Both server and the client must cooperate in order to eliminate these threats.
Angular comes pre-configured with strategies that address these issues, but for this to work backend
server cooperation is required.</p>
<h3 id="cross-site-request-forgery-xsrf-csrf-">Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF/CSRF)</h3>
<p>Protection from XSRF is provided by using the double-submit cookie defense pattern.
For more information please visit <a href="api/ng/service/$http#cross-site-request-forgery-xsrf-protection">XSRF protection</a>.</p>
<h3 id="json-hijacking-protection">JSON Hijacking Protection</h3>
<p>Protection from JSON Hijacking is provided if the server prefixes all JSON requests with following string <code>&quot;)]}&#39;,\n&quot;</code>.
Angular will automatically strip the prefix before processing it as JSON.
For more information please visit <a href="api/ng/service/$http#json-vulnerability-protection">JSON Hijacking Protection</a>.</p>
<h2 id="strict-contextual-escaping">Strict Contextual Escaping</h2>
<p>Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE) is a mode in which AngularJS requires bindings in certain contexts to require
a value that is marked as safe to use for that context.</p>
<p>This mode is implemented by the <a href="api/ng/service/$sce"><code>$sce</code></a> service and various core directives.</p>
<p>One example of such a context is rendering arbitrary content via the <a href="api/ng/directive/ngBindHtml"><code>ngBindHtml</code></a> directive. If the content is
provided by a user there is a chance of Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The <a href="api/ng/directive/ngBindHtml"><code>ngBindHtml</code></a> directive will not
render content that is not marked as safe by <a href="api/ng/service/$sce"><code>$sce</code></a>. The <a href="api/ngSanitize"><code>ngSanitize</code></a> module can be used to clean such
user provided content and mark the content as safe.</p>
<p><strong>Be aware that marking untrusted data as safe via calls to <a href="api/ng/service/$sce#trustAsHtml"><code>$sce.trustAsHtml</code></a>, etc is
dangerous and will lead to Cross Site Scripting exploits.</strong></p>
<p>For more information please visit <a href="api/ng/service/$sce"><code>$sce</code></a> and <a href="api/ngSanitize/service/$sanitize"><code>$sanitize</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="using-local-caches">Using Local Caches</h2>
<p>There are various places that the browser can store (or cache) data. Within Angular there are objects created by
the <a href="api/ng/service/$cacheFactory"><code>$cacheFactory</code></a>. These objects, such as <a href="api/ng/service/$templateCache"><code>$templateCache</code></a> are used to store and retrieve data,
primarily used by <a href="api/ng/service/$http"><code>$http</code></a> and the <a href="api/ng/directive/script"><code>script</code></a> directive to cache templates and other data.</p>
<p>Similarly the browser itself offers <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code> objects for caching data.</p>
<p><strong>Attackers with local access can retrieve sensitive data from this cache even when users are not authenticated.</strong></p>
<p>For instance in a long running Single Page Application (SPA), one user may &quot;log out&quot;, but then another user
may access the application without refreshing, in which case all the cached data is still available.</p>
