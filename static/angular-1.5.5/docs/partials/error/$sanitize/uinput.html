<h2>Description</h2>
<div class="description">
  <p>This error occurs when <code>$sanitize</code> sanitizer tries to check the input for possible mXSS payload and the verification
errors due to the input mutating indefinitely. This could be a sign that the payload contains code exploiting an mXSS
vulnerability in the browser.</p>
<p>mXSS attack exploit browser bugs that cause some browsers parse a certain html strings into DOM, which once serialized
doesn&#39;t match the original input. These browser bugs can be exploited by attackers to create payload which looks
harmless to sanitizers, but due to mutations caused by the browser are turned into dangerous code once processed after
sanitization.</p>
